/*
From V20:
Passion
The vampire stirs his victim’s emotions, either
heightening them to a fevered pitch or blunting them
until the target is completely desensitized. The Cain-
ite may not choose which emotion is affected; she may
only amplify or dull emotions already present in the
target. In this way, a vampire can inflame mild irrita-
tion into quivering rage or atrophy true love into ca-
sual interest.

System: The character talks to their victim, and
the vampire’s player rolls Charisma + Empathy (dif-
ficulty equals the victim’s Humanity or Path rating).
The number of successes determines the duration of
the altered state of feeling. Effects of this power might
include one- or two-point additions or subtractions
to difficulties of frenzy rolls, Virtue rolls, rolls to resist
Presence powers, etc

/*
From V20:
The Haunting
The vampire manipulates the sensory centers of their
victim’s brain, flooding the victim’s senses with visions,
sounds, scents, or feelings that aren’t really there. The
images, regardless of the sense to which they appeal,
are only fleeting “glimpses,” barely perceptible to the
victim. The vampire using Dementation cannot con-
trol what the victim perceives, but may choose which
sense is affected.

The “haunting” effects occur mainly when the vic-
tim is alone, and mostly at night. They may take the
form of the subject’s repressed fears, guilty memories,
or anything else that the Storyteller finds dramatically
appropriate. The effects are never pleasant or unobtru-
sive, however. The Storyteller should let her imagina-
tion run wild when describing these sensory impres-
sions; the victim may well feel as if she is going mad, or
as if the world is.

System: After the vampire speaks to the victim, the
player spends a blood point and rolls Manipulation +
Subterfuge (difficulty of his victim’s Perception + Self-
Control/Instinct). The number of successes determines
the length of the sensory “visitations.” The precise ef-
fects are up to the Storyteller, though particularly ee-
rie or harrowing apparitions can certainly reduce dice
pools for a turn or two after the manifestation.

From V20:
Eyes of Chaos
This peculiar power allows the vampire to take ad-
vantage of the fleeting clarity hidden in insanity. She
may scrutinize the “patterns” of a person’s soul, the
convolutions of a vampire’s inner nature, or even ran-
dom events in nature itself. The Kindred with this
power can discern the most well-hidden psychoses, or
gain insight into a person’s true self. Malkavians with
this power often have (or claim to have) knowledge of
the moves and countermoves of the great Jyhad, or the
patterns of fate.

System: This power allows a vampire to determine a
person’s true Nature, among other things. The vampire
concentrates for a turn, then her player rolls Perception
+ Occult. The difficulty depends on the intricacy of the
pattern. Discerning the Nature of a stranger would be
difficulty 9, a casual acquaintance would be an 8, and
an established ally a 6. The vampire could also read
the message locked in a coded missive (difficulty 7), or
even see the doings of an invisible hand in such events
as the pattern of falling leaves (difficulty 6). Almost
anything might contain some hidden insight, no mat-
ter how trivial or meaningless. The patterns are pres-
ent in most things, but are often so intricate they can
keep a vampire spellbound for hours while she tries to
understand their message.

This is a potent power, subject to adjudication. Sto-
rytellers, this power is an effective way to introduce
plot threads for a chronicle, reveal an overlooked clue,
foreshadow important events, or communicate critical

information a player seeks. Important to its use, though,
is delivering the information properly. Secrets revealed
via Eyes of Chaos are never simple facts; they’re tanta-
lizing symbols adrift in a sea of madness. Describe the
results of this power in terms of allegory: “The man
before you appears as a crude marionette, with garish
features painted in bright stage makeup, and strings
vanishing up into the night sky.” Avoid stating plainly,
“You learn that this ghoul is the minion of a powerful
Methuselah.”

From V20:
Voice of Madness
By merely addressing their victims aloud, the Kindred
can drive targets into fits of blind rage or fear, forcing
them to abandon reason and higher thought. Victims
are plagued by hallucinations of their subconscious de-
mons, and try to flee or destroy their hidden shames.
Tragedy almost always follows in the wake of this pow-
er’s use, though offending Malkavians often claim that
they were merely encouraging people to act “according
to their natures.” Unfortunately for the vampire con-
cerned, he runs a very real risk of falling prey to their
own voice’s power.

System: The player spends a blood point and makes
a Manipulation + Empathy roll (difficulty 7). One tar-
get is affected per success, although all potential vic-
tims must be listening to the vampire’s voice.
Affected victims fly immediately into frenzy or a
blind fear like Rötschreck. Kindred or other creatures
capable of frenzy, such as Lupines, may make a frenzy
check or Rötschreck test (Storyteller’s choice as to how
they are affected) at +2 difficulty to resist the power.
Mortals are automatically affected and don’t remember
their actions while berserk. The frenzy or fear lasts for
a scene, though vampires and Lupines may test as usual
to snap out of it.

The vampire using Voice of Madness must also test
for frenzy or Rötschreck upon invoking this power,
though his difficulty to resist is one lower than nor-
mal. If the initial roll to invoke this power is a failure,
however, the roll to resist the frenzy is one higher than
normal. If the roll to invoke this power is a botch, the
frenzy or Rötschreck response is automatic.
