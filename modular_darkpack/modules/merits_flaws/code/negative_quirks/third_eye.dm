For Salubri, this is a dangerous proposition, exposing you to Kindred who believe the Tremere's stories of your clan being rife with infernal diablerists. For Tremere, this flaw manifests as a miraculous inheritance of the Diablerie of Saulot, almost certainly dooming your standing in Clan Tremere to be mistrusted at best, and immediately killed at worse. Your permanent third eye can be covered with a hat. This flaw is only available to Tremere and Salubri."
