Supernaturally graceful and charming, the Divas are always looking for the next thrill, leaving a detritus of discarded lovers and victims in their wake. The Toreador are lovers of beauty and anything artistic, who are common in Kindred high society. Strongly aligned with the Camarilla, they concern themselves with culture and influence. Some are patrons of the arts, while others obsess over modern trends and fleeting sensations. Anything can be art, if the Toreador regards it as such. Their curse causes them to become dangerously entranced by beauty and emotion."
