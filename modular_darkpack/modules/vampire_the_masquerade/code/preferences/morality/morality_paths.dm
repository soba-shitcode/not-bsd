	desc = "The Path of Humanity, the most common Path across all Kindred by far, and the only Path which is deemed to be acceptable by the Camarilla, posits that the only way to resist the Beast is by staying true to the values and nature of mortal life. Much in the way the Masquerade seeks to conceal the awareness of vampires from mortal society, the Path of Humanity seeks to suppress the Beast by denying Vampirism and it's darkest urges, and thus, the Masquerade and Humanity go hand-in-hand. Humanity, unlike most Paths, has many advantages, including affecting how 'human' a vampire may look to others. A character who has embraced a Path of Enlightenment or is distant from their Humanity may never breathe or blink, may exhibit animalistic snarls or sunken eyes. Make no mistake - a Vampire on the Path of Humantiy is not a saint. Vampires are predators by nature, and just because they follow this Path doesn't mean they're not. Most mortals are on this Path - but ironically enough, a vampire extremely high in humanity may seem more human than most mortals. Deviating from this Path is intensely dangerous, requires extremely low Humanity, and requires a mentor, and your character will have forever discarded all remaining behaviors, beliefs, appearance, and morality of what once made them human."

Based on the Book of the Empty Heart by Rathmonicus, it was first disseminated among a few Kindred in the Catholic Church; its scriptures were later reunited and compiled by the True Black Hand. The Path of the Scorched Heart controls the Beast by systematically eradicating every emotion within the vampire's heart.

Scholars of death and the transition into it, followers of this Path benefit Necromantic and Thanatological study via the knowledge they bring, rather than the political or pragmatic benefits of their concourse with the dead. This Path is sometimes derided as one that celebrates wanton murder, but the Gravedigger's curiosity supercedes their concern for life - and their encounters with all manner of mortality can be made victim of their grim curiosity, causing them to rarely deal with mortals, resulting in a very introverted, quiet temperament."

Also like the Faithful, the Redeemers seek redemption and forgiveness, and to earn it requires suffering and purification. However, instead of the fairly benign ways of the Faithful, the Redeemers actively go about the world of man, punishing and killing mortal sinners. Some followers of Via Noctis offer penance for lesser deeds, and still others will Embrace irredeemable mortals to help them in their punishment. They also target Cainites who would tempt mortals into corruption, outstanding examples being the Followers of Set and the Baali."

Known for their loyalty to their group, their leaders, and it's allies, as well as their firm devotion to upholding their own word and promises, these vampires place duty above all else. Adherents are called Knights, Patriots, or Canonici. Make no mistake - vampires who follow this path are not compassionate or humane in any sense. Indeed, they still see humans as little more than chattel or food, and undeserving of the considerations of honor that are bestowed on other vampires."

Adherents swear to study, reflect, and unearth the true nature of what it means to be a vampire, as well as embrace and reach the ultimate form of the condition. Followers are often scholarly or introspective vampires who excel in their discipline and rigor. Noddists swear to cast aside their lost humanity, embrace their new condition, emulate Caine in all things, as well as take the vitae of the unworthy through Diablerie to become closer to the Dark Father. Sins include befriending or co-existing with mortals, succumbing to Frenzy or Rotschrek, failing to diablerize a 'Humane' vampire, failing to engage in study or research into vampirism, as well as denying the inherent needs of a vampire by failing to feed or by showing compassion."

The Cathar heresy posited that the world was created in equal parts by a good ('light') creator, responsible for virtue and spirit, and an evil ('dark') creator, responsible for the material world and all it's vices. Vampires who follow this path reason that since those cursed with vampirism are denied the everlasting spiritual peace of an afterlife, due to their immortality, the very essence of their being is to favor this 'dark' creator by tempting others with all the trappings of the material world. Followers of this path, in a way, thus seek spirituality in 'depravity'. Sins include showing restraint, showing trust, murder, sacrificing your own gratification for someone else's convenience, refraining from indulgence, or encouraging others to excersize restraint."

Considered heretical by most Cainites of the Sabbat, the Bahari practice the ancient ways handed down by Lilith herself, believing that pain, tribulation, and suffering, are the only roads to learning and true growth. Only through suffering, experiencing the limits of creation and it's sensations, can understanding be had, is what these vampires believe, with little compassion for those who lack the insight or the will to embark upon it's journey. Sins include feeding immediately when hungry, pursuing wealth or power, not correcting others regarding the story of Caine and Lilith, feeling remorse for someone in pain, fearing death, murder, failing to dispense pain and anguish, and shunning pain."

/datum/morality/lilith/midwives
	name = "Path of the Red Midwives"
	desc = "A variant of Bahari beliefs, those of this path find birth and creation to be their art. The inhuman and monstrous creatures around them, or those which are newly embraced, are a glory to behold and assist in searching for power in this world."

/datum/morality/lilith/thorn
	name = "Path of the Thorn Garden"

/datum/morality/redemption
	name = "Path of Redemption"
	desc = "There are thousands of terms for God. Jesus, Yahweh, Allah, Ahura-Mazda. Yet one thing is certain: Vampires, being immortal, being cursed by God, witnessing the Great Flood, and being in the First City know that God is real. Followers of this Path are thus extremely devoted believers in their faith and religious principles, using the Curse as evidence of their chance for redemption on the day of their judgment by a benevolent creator. Indeed, vampires are outcasts of Heaven, but could this all be a test? Commonly called 'Martyrs', those who follow the Path of Redemption seek to redeem themselves by sacrificing themselves for others, undoing the selfish, animalistic pull of the Beast and making themselves worthy of the forgiveness of their chosen God (or Gods) once more. Yet God does not expect perfection. Followers of this path embrace the Divine Tide, or the natural cycle of sin, forgiveness, and rebirth. Followers of this Path are also often expected to take confession from members also on this Path, and confess, in turn. Vampires who follow this path are not saints - in fact, they recognize sin as an unfortunate, cyclical destiny as part of the Divine Tide, hoping to one day overcome it with a great and final act of martyrdom, redemption. Sins include not following the ethos of your religion, putting physical needs before spiritual, refusing to offer the opportunity of redemption to others, refusing to take or give confession, allowing a cardinal sin to go unpunished (such as lust, gluttony, anger, pride), and the murder of innocents. Blood Magic is looked down upon by this Path."

/datum/morality/revelation
	name = "Path of Evil Revelations"
	desc = "The Demons, the Fallen Angels, were the first children of God, before man was made from clay, and before the life of Caine. The First Rebel, the Lord Lucifer, demanded explanations from God about His forbidden creations in Shadow, the Qlipphoth, and God not only denied him, but banished him from Heaven forevermore, along with his allies, for if God explained the nature of these creations to Lucifer, it would reveal that God is a fool. An unjust, tyrannical Father who plays favorites with his Children. This great injustice, hidden from the comprehension of mortals, will be undone when Lucifer completes his rebellion. His army of Demons outnumbers the Angels, and when the pretenders are thrown out, Creation will be made right. Vampires who follow the Path of Revelations, called 'Infernalists' thus obey and call themselves allies of Demons, believing themselves natural allies as both are outcasts of Heaven, outside the natural order - after all, vampires hunt humans, God's children. Followers of this Path do not merely accept their inner evil, plenty of other Paths offer that. To follow this Path requires a participation in a battle much more ancient than humankind, than vampirism, than creation itself, in service to an unfathomable 'evil'. Sins include obeying any laws, failing to observe infernalist rituals, altruistic acts, not grabbing power when the opportunity is present, showing self-interest, refusing to support infernal atrocities, failing to serve your Patron Demon, and allowing yourself to be defeated, or outsmarted, by the servants of God."

/datum/morality/entelechy
	name = "Path of Entelechy"
	desc = "Developed by the European Brujah, this intellectual Path posits that Via Humanitas' focus on rejecting the Beast and suppressing it is a passive thing and will never be enough. One must actively fight the Beast with rigorous and disciplined intellectualism, traits which were once essential among Clan Brujah, and traits which they hope, with this Path and it's followers, will reclaim their rightful place as Warrior-Princes among Kindred. With three core principles: Enkrateia (inner strength), Reie (courage) and Saphrosyne (control of the self), this demanding and diligent Path is an eternal battle against the Beast, whereas Humanity merely rejects it. Sins include ill defined or idle thinking, acting on impulse, petty crime like theft robbery or vandalism, causing deliberate harm to any mortal, feeding from an innocent by force, succumbing to the beast, allowing a crime to go unpunished, the murder of innocents, or aiding someone on another path. Never show cowardice. Never take mortals for granted. Feed only to live, no more. Commit yourself to rigorous study and reflection and you will master the Beast. This Path is extremely rare, a grand majority of it's followers being Elder Brujah spreading it once more in reaction to the 'fallen' state of the clan as the Anarch Free State struggles against the New Promise Mandarinate."

	desc = "In 623 AD, a Cainite named Suleiman ibn Abdullah visited the city of Medina, seeking to make a hunt of sorts, and feed, on the Prophet Muhammad. Suleiman asked for an audience with the Prophet, and, when granted one, was absolutely stunned by the man's divinity, and bowed before him, overhwlemed by the man's divinity as God's messenger. Suleiman Ibn Abdullah became the first of the Ahirra, the Brotherhood, Vampires who swore to uphold God's holy law as set forth by His Final and Greatest Prophet. In this way, the demon within, the Beast, may be silenced, and a vampire may seek forgiveness from God through prayer and unshakeable faith. Sins include failing to observe the Five Pillars of Islam nightly, not spreading the Faith of Islam, failing to be charitable when necessary, embracing a non-believer, enslaving someone, breaking an oath, murder. Do not feed from an unbeliever. It is preferable to feed from animals. Do not embrace a non-believer, and do not embrace believers, lest they have given consent. The blood bond is slavery - only non-believers must be subjected to it, and if they show true piety to God, they may be released. Follow God in all things, and the Beast inside will be purged.

As members of an intuitive Path, the Corrupted only use common terminology after working together for some time, though advanced followers display a strange synchronicity at times. They may call the presence they summon forth a “shadow within” or a “Watcher,” or identify with one of the Qlippothic demons associated with Vicissitude. Vicissitude is the focus of the Corrupted’s obsessions. It spreads this power through blood and instruction as widely as possible. They resent untainted Kindred who inherit Vicissitude through a Clan or bloodline, devoting special attention to converting or destroying them."
